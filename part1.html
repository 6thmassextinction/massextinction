					<p>And I happened to go on vacation with my family and you know, after about just two
or three weeks with my family, I wanted to escape, and so looked for something to
read, something that would be comforting, something that would remind me of a
place where I felt safe. So I downloaded Harry Potter! And I started reading it, and
not only did it make me feel comfortable and safe, and took me out of the situation I
was in and into an imaginary world which I loved already, but the themes and the
questions that were in these books were so… big! They were just as big as the Bible
questions I’d just been reading, you know.</p>
